<center><h1>Military TAPS</h1></center>

<center><p>
	This site was created while I was in one of the many TAPS classes occuring around the country.  The one issue some of the members
	saw in the class, was that there was not a one stop shop for the retiring or seperating member to find all the links to the loads of useful
	information. 
</p>
<p>
	So, this is an attempt to get as much information onto one site for any member of any military component to use to their advantage.

<h2>Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL)</h2>
	<p>
		From the actual COOL site hosted by DOD.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Department of Defense (DOD) Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) is the result of extensive inter-Service collaboration to facilitate credentialing of Service members. All Services recognize the important role that occupational credentials can play in professionalizing the Force and in enhancing the Service member’s ability to transition to the civilian workforce upon completion of military service. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard each have their own Service-specific COOL programs designed to match military occupations to civilian credentials (occupational certifications, licenses, and apprenticeships) and provide resources to help Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen attain these credentials.

<h2>Pay Check Research and Comparison</h2>
	<p>
	This site is hosted by the DOD.  Summary below is directly from the DOD Site.
	</p>
	<p>
		Regular Military Compensation (RMC) is defined as the sum of basic pay, average basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence, and the federal income tax advantage that accrues because the allowances are not subject to federal income tax. RMC represents a basic level of compensation which every service member receives, directly or indirectly, in-cash or in-kind, and which is common to all military personnel based on their pay grade, years of service, and family size.

		<br>This calculator will compute your regular military compensation based on your inputs. Regular military compensation is the approximate amount of an equivalent civilian salary.</br>

		<br>The information requested is necessary to determine your cash salary elements and estimate your marginal Federal tax bracket. No identifying data is requested nor retained by this web site.</br>
